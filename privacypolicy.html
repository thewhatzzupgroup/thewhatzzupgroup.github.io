Maintain & improve our services



We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve AI features used across our services.

Develop new services



We use the information may collect  in existing services to help us develop new ones.

Provide personalized services, including content and ads



We use the information may collect  to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results.

For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Whatzzup. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.

We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.

We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless ask ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Whatzzup Analytics.
